# NOTICE
This is a slightly watered down version compared to the one me and some people might have

I'm also making this public cause nobody I've given it too has propertly bug tested it

# Prerequisites
1) models exported with [minmode's PMX noesis script](https://www.deviantart.com/minmode/art/Update-1-6-Noesis-PMX-VMD-export-809252773)

Both games are easily accessible so there should be little to no problems with getting files

# PLEASE READ

this shader is pretty much self explanatory to my [unity shader](https://github.com/GalacticFairy/Uta-Macross-Shader)

Sampler goes into Sph slot
and AlphaMask (if any) goes into Toon

MMD already sets these as black and white (respectively) so no worries about not having one or the other in a slot

then just make a "eye_right" and "eye_down" morph and a "Blush" morph if you're using ripped motions with ripped facials(or if you actually want to be able to move the eyes)

# RULES

1) Please credit me for the shader work
2) No r-18 content (seriously one of the characters is technically 3 years old)
3) you are free to edit the shader to your discrestion
